# Definition
* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition of chronic dyspnea with expiratory airflow limitation that does not significantly fluctuate
* It is also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)
* The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease as “a preventable and treatable disease with some significant extrapulmonary effects that may contribute to the severity in individual patients”
* There are two classifications of COPD: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These two types of COPD can have overlapping signs and symptoms
* The primary cause of the obstruction may vary; examples include airway inflammation, mucous plugging, narrowed airway lumina, or airway destruction

### Chronic Bronchitis clinical diagnosis
A disease of the airways and is defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years
* Patients with Chronic Bronchitis, often referred to as "Blue Bloaters," are large, edematous persons with cyanosis and relatively little dyspnea.

### Emphysema pathological diagnosis
An abnormal distention of airspaces beyond the terminal bronchioles and destruction of the walls of the alveoli
* Patients with Emphysema, often referred to as "Pink Puffers," are thin, cachetic persons with marked shortness of breath—the decreased lung compliance leads to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.

# Management

### Goals to achieve include:
* Improvement in gas exchange
* Achievement of airway clearance
* Improvement in breathing pattern
* Independence in self-care activities
* Improvement in activity intolerance
* Ventilation/oxygenation adequate to meet self-care needs
* Nutritional intake meeting caloric needs
* Infection treated/prevented
* Disease process/prognosis and therapeutic regimen understood
* Plan in place to meet needs after discharge

### Nursing priorities
* Maintain airway patency
* Assist with measures to facilitate gas exchange
* Enhance nutritional intake
* Prevent complications, slow progression of condition
* Provide information about disease process/prognosis and treatment regimen

### Nursing interventions
* Patient and family teaching is an important nursing intervention to enhance self-management in patients with any chronic pulmonary disorder

# Question
Which of the following is NOT a treatment used to manage COPD?
[RIGHT] Isolation
[WRONG] Smoking cessation
[WRONG] Oxygen therapy

* Cessation of smoking
* Reduction of exposure to airway irritants
* Oxygen
* Prevention of infection
* Treatment of purulent sputum with antimicrobials – Erythromycin
* Pharmacological intervention is similar to asthma

# Anticholinergic agents 
* Decrease airway secretions and smooth muscle tone
* TRIVER 2 puffs QID – mainstay of therapy
* Side effects – dry mouth and hacking cough

# Bronchodilators

# Question
Albuterol, terbutaline, and metaproterenol are examples of what classification of drugs?
[RIGHT] Bronchodilators
[WRONG] Expectorants
[WRONG] Antibiotics

# Question
The bronchodilator Salmeterol (Serevent) is which of the following:
[RIGHT] A long acting inhaled agent
[WRONG] A short acting inhaled agent

### Short acting inhaled agents - 2 puffs QID and PRN
* Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin)
* Metaproterenol (Alupent)
* Pirbuterol (Maxir)
* Terbutaline (Brethine) 2 puffs TID

### Short acting ORAL agents. 
* Albuterol(Volmax) – 2 – 4 mg TID
* Albuterol extended release (Repetab) 4 mg q 12h

### Long acting inhaled agents 
* Salmeterol (Serevent). Prolonged receptor-binding, requires patient education to avoid cardiac arrhythmias

# Corticosteroids
 
# Question
Triamcinolone (Azmacort), fluticasone (Flovent), and beclomethasone (Vanceril) are examples of which drug classification?
[RIGHT] Corticosteroids
[WRONG] Bronchodilators
[WRONG] Antitussives

# Question
How are triamcinolone (Azmacort), fluticasone (Flovent), and beclomethasone (Vanceril) delivered?
[RIGHT] Metered dose inhaler
[WRONG] Oral tablets

# Question
An oral corticosteroid that is commonly prescribed for the treatment of respiratory illnesses is:
[RIGHT] Prednisone
[WRONG] Triamcinolone
[WRONG] Fluticasone

### Metered dose inhalers. 
* Triamcinilone acetonide (Azmacort)
* Fluticasone propionate (Flovent)
* Beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent, Vanceril)

### Oral tablets
* Prednisone

### IV
* Methylprednisone (Medrol)
* Methylprednisone sodium succinate (Solumedrol) for severe exacerbations

### Intramuscular
* Methylprednisolone (Depo-medrol)
* Triamicinole acetozide (Kenalog)

# Drug for Respiratory Muscles and Bronchodilator Activity

### Theophylline
* Theodur
* Undur
* Uniphyl-theophylline time released

# Drug for Thinning Sputum
* Glyceryl guaiacolate (Hytuss, Robitussin)
* Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst)
