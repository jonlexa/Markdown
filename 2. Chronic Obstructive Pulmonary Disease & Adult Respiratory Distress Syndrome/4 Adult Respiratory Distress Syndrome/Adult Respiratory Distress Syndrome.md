# Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
* Severe form of respiratory failure that occurs in previously healthy individuals
* Characterized by lung edema, formation of hyaline membranes, microatelectasis, alveolar hemorrhage causing dyspnea  and hypoxia

# Question
Which of the following is a common cardiovascular complication in patients with acute respiratory failure?
[WRONG] Hypertension
[RIGHT] Endocarditis
[WRONG] Aortic Coarctation
[WRONG] Coronary artery spasm

Common cardiovascular complications in patients with acute respiratory failure include hypotension, reduced cardiac output, arrhythmia, endocarditis, and acute myocardial infarction. These complications may be related to the underlying disease process, mechanical ventilation, or the use of pulmonary artery catheters.

# Question Which of the following is not considered a routine investigation in patients with suspected respiratory failure?
[WRONG] Chest x-ray
[WRONG] Arterial blood gas analysis
[RIGHT] Right-sided heart catheterization
[WRONG] Electrocardiography

Respiratory failure may be associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. However, these are nonspecific, and very significant respiratory failure may be present without dramatic signs or symptoms. This emphasizes the importance of measuring arterial blood gases in all patients who are seriously ill or in whom respiratory failure is suspected. Chest x-ray is essential. Echocardiography is not routinely done but is sometimes useful. Pulmonary functions tests, if feasible, may be helpful. Electrocardiography should be performed to evaluate the possibility of a cardiovascular cause of respiratory failure; it also may detect dysrhythmias resulting from severe hypoxemia or acidosis. Right-sided heart catheterization is controversial.

# Question Which of the following indicates an airflow obstruction in a patient with suspected chronic respiratory failure?
[WRONG] A forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) level >1 L
[WRONG] A forced vital capacity (FVC) level >1.5 L
[RIGHT] A decrease in the FEV1-to-FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC)
[WRONG] A reduction in both FEV1 and FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC

Normal values for FEV1 and FVC suggest a disturbance in respiratory control. A decrease in FEV1/FVC indicates airflow obstruction, whereas a reduction in both FEV1 and FVC and maintenance of FEV1/FVC suggest restrictive lung disease.
Respiratory failure is uncommon in obstructive diseases when FEV1 is >1 L and in restrictive diseases when FVC is >1 L.

# Question Which of the following is recommended to avoid severe dynamic hyperinflation in patients with respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation?
[RIGHT] Tidal volume of 6 mL/kg
[WRONG] Tidal volume of 8-10 mL/kg
[WRONG] Respiratory rates of 13-15 breaths/min
[WRONG] Respiratory rates >15 breaths/min

After the initiation of mechanical ventilation, patients with status asthmaticus frequently develop severe dynamic hyperinflation, which is often associated with adverse hemodynamic effects. The development of dynamic hyperinflation can be minimized by delivering the lowest possible minute ventilation in the least possible time. Therefore, the initial ventilatory strategy should involve the delivery of relatively low tidal volumes (eg, 6 mL/kg) and lower respiratory rates (eg, 8-12 breaths/min) with a high inspiratory flow rate.

# Etiology
* Shock of any etiology
* Infectious cause (sepsis)
* Micro emboli- fat or air embolism
* Liquid aspiration
* Inhaled toxins – smoke, toxic agents
* Metabolic disorders
* Trauma
* Eclampsia
* Oxygen toxicity
* Banked blood- large amounts
* Over-hydration
* Drug overdose – particularly heroin
* Cardiopulmonary bypass

# Pathogenesis
* Diffuse damage to that alveolar-capillary membrane
* Increased permeability and leakage of fluid at the alveolar-capillary membrane
* Damage to type II pneumocytes
* Interstitial and alveolar edema results in interference with gas exchange and hypoxemia. Reduced FRC, Intrapulmonary shunting and Decreased compliance
* Protein exudates destroy surfactant causing alveolar collapse
* Protein exudates from the hyaline membrane causes interstitial fibrosis
* Profound Hypoxemia – exists in spite of high-inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2)

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical Presentation
* Tachypnea
* Increasing dyspnea
* Hyperventilation
* Respiratory distress
* Labored respirations
* Retractions
* Cyanosis
* Restlessness, anxiety

# Diagnostics

### ABG
* Refractory hypoxemia – hallmark of disease refractoy to O2 therapy (PaO2<55 mmHg)
* Hypocapnia – compensatory increase in minute ventilation to maintain PaO2 until patient fatigues
* Respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventialtion

### CXR
* Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
![](assets/cxr1.png)
![](assets/cxr2.png)

### Pulmonary Function Tests
* PaO2<55 mmHg on FIO2 ..50
* Decreased lung compliance
* Reduced functional residual capacity
* Right to left shunt
* PaO2/FIO2 ratio = PaO2/FIO2
* Normal ratio – 300 to 400
* Acute lung injury – 200 to 300
* ARDS - <200

# Question
Your patients' PaO2 / FiO2 ratio is < 200, what does this suggest?

[RIGHT] Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
[WRONG] Normal Pulmonary Function
[WRONG] Acute Lung Injury

# Management

### Maintaining patent airway
* Restoration of arterial oxygen levels
 * Lowest FIO2 to produce oxygen saturation
 * Maintain PaO2 level within acceptable range

### Mechanical Ventilation
* Set RR and TV to meet ventilation requirements
* Lower tidal volumes- decreases risk of barotrauma

### Use of PEEP
* Improves oxygenation by re-expanding alveoli
* Decrease shunting by opening non-ventilatory lung units
* Use lowest level of PEEP
* High PEEP may decrease cardiac output and increase barotrauma

### Endotrachael tubes

### Tracheostomy tube

### Cardiovascular Support
* Fluid management
* Inotropic/vasoactive support
* Normalize Hgb
* Appropriate use of hemodynamic monitoring
* Sedation/paralysis/pain management
* Narcotic – pain management
* Benzodiazepines – sedation, amnesia and muscle relaxants
* Neuromuscular blocking agents (paralytic agents)

### Pharmacological Support
* Antibiotics
* Antipyretics – avoid cooling blankets which may cause shivering

### Nutritional Support
